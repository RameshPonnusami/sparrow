Slush
1. Uses sparrow to rely on building the propreitary processes
2. Sparrow not only will host the dsl code, but also will have the runtime environment
3. Slush will host only the processes meaent for chimera project
4. Slush will also host any propreitary java code meant for slush integration
5. Slush will also use the utilities project available under jpvelsamy to build the management console to manage both sparrow and chimera instances
6. Checkout slush also into sparrow workspace
7. Build a new eclipse plugin and import it into usual java ide using text ide

For now I will make sure that I have enough grammar support to deal with our current requirements
1. Run the sequence of sql steps to execute the demand forecast table
2. perform audit related activities
3. Run google caltendar integration work


Required actions
1. readrow
2. callprocess
3. transform
4. publishevent
5. writeaudit
6. writecsv

I am little confused with respect to choosing the right logging solution. Will determine what's best eventually.
But for now, I am going to stick to typesafe's offering - scala logging. Though I do not like the fact that it 
looks like inherting the logger, for now I shall live with it.


I have come really a long distance today and with the following status update, I am signing off for today
1. Added grammar support
2. Added scala support
3. Added the first iteration of the process runtime

To change the color of the ls font 
https://askubuntu.com/questions/466198/how-do-i-change-the-color-for-directories-with-ls-in-the-console
https://windows.gadgethacks.com/how-to/change-font-size-windows-10-0166687/
https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/

I have taken care of setting up the environment,
1. Setting up the windows using the display size to 125%
2. Increasing the font size for Eclipse
3. Increasing the font fize for ubuntu bash

The folder color is disturbing in ubuntu bash, so fixing it first
https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7556
https://github.com/neilpa/cmd-colors-solarized - dit not work

Spent nearly an hour and finally found the solution in here
https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/bash-shell-change-the-color-of-my-shell-prompt-under-linux-or-unix/

Another potential good read on changing the color of the prompt
https://www.howtogeek.com/307701/how-to-customize-and-colorize-your-bash-prompt/

Actual solution
export PS1="\[\e]0;\u@\h: \w\a\]${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\[\033[01;32m\]\u@\h\[\033[00m\]:\[\033[01;37m\]\w\[\033[00m\]\=>"

The next thing is to get the python based build ready
I have indeed copied the files, but for now  I am backing off as I am not
too keen on fixing another stupid ops problem for now

I will just do 
mvn clean compile install -Dmaven.test.skip=true

On the fatjar item, I have decided to use alchemi option
http://davidb.github.io/scala-maven-plugi


I got stuck on the second item for nearlly four hours !
For now I have decided not pursue querulous because of lack of complete support
I have written my version of the configuration code and moving on to next item


Moving on the aliasn name to file name resolution


Checking out from chimera, when you have two different bit bucket accounts
git clone git@chimera.bitbucket.org:jana-lasalle/slush.git

drop this changed configuration(filename-config) into your $user/.ssh folder
Host chimera.bitbucket.org
User git
Hostname bitbucket.org

So far I have made sure that the ProcessRuntime in the single thread
model is complete till the time the process gets fired. Now I need to
turn my focus towards getting both the actions implemented
