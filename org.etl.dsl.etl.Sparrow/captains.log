Slush
1. Uses sparrow to rely on building the propreitary processes
2. Sparrow not only will host the dsl code, but also will have the runtime environment
3. Slush will host only the processes meaent for chimera project
4. Slush will also host any propreitary java code meant for slush integration
5. Slush will also use the utilities project available under jpvelsamy to build the management console to manage both sparrow and chimera instances
6. Checkout slush also into sparrow workspace
7. Build a new eclipse plugin and import it into usual java ide using text ide

For now I will make sure that I have enough grammar support to deal with our current requirements

I am little confused with respect to choosing the right logging solution. Will determine what's best eventually.
But for now, I am going to stick to typesafe's offering - scala logging. Though I do not like the fact that it 
looks like inherting the logger, for now I shall live with it.


I have come really a long distance today and with the following status update, I am signing off for today
1. Added grammar support
2. Added scala support
3. Added the first iteration of the process runtime
